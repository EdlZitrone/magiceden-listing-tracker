# magiceden-listing-tracker
To start the process you have to put the symbols of the collections of your choice in the brackets at 'collections'.
Also your discord webhook url has to be put as 'webhook_url'. You can then execute the code and listings should be posted by the webhook.
I would strongly advise you to change the emotes from the embed in line 29ff. I am always available for questions on discord: EdlZitrone#6631
